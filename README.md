## Accessing the project
### Before you start!
- Make sure you have [MetaMask Wallet Extension](https://metamask.io/) installed in your browser of choice.
    - Also make sure you are swapped to the Goleri Testnet. [instructions here](https://devtonight.com/posts/metamask-testnet-wallet-setup-for-blockchain-development#)

***

- The **easiest** way to access the project is to go to **[https://cal3dly.surge.sh](https://cal3dly.surge.sh)**
- If you *desire* to build the project locally:
    - Make sure you have nodejs installed
    - Clone repo
    - From root repo folder run:
    ```
    cd frontend
    ```
    - Then run:
    ```
    npm i
    ... node output ...
    npm run dev
    ```
    - The frontend should be served on <u>localhost:3000</u>
    - The Smart Contract is deployed on test network already so nothing to do there
